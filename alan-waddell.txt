Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        Block elements are bullies. They push out elements in their line. Inline elements occupy as much space as their content takes up.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        An element with an absolute position is placed relative to its nearest ancestor. 
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        Using flexbox, one could use the justify-content: space-around / space-between property:value pair. 
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        Display block elements: h1, div, p. Display inline elements: a, span, img. Display inline-block: nav.
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
        The box model is a guide for how to structure content. A set of CSS rules that decides how element sizes are computed. 
        The fix for the model, in my experience, is using percentage/vh values. Couple these values with flexbox display properties and content reactive/retains its shape.
